Welcome to GOARK This is a game I created to learn Godot. I'm excited to share
it with you and would love to hear your feedback for improvements.

## Description

GoArk is an Arkanoid-inspired game with a twist: you start each level with 5
balls and can control the launch of each ball. The goal is to strategically
use these balls to maximize your score and break through the toughest levels.
If no ball is in play, you lose.
